# SNF_HRX_Toewalking
Codes connected to our SNF Project (Nr. 32003B_200903): "Stop tip-toeing around toe-walking". 

Within the project we try to manipulate the feeling of stability by use of 1. VR or 2. bodyweight perturbations. We measure how a change in feeling of stability relates to changes in postural/dynamic stability and perifiral/cortical control.

Motion capture (vicon), EMG (cometa), and force plates (kistler) were used to collect kinematics, muscle activity, and kinetics. 

The project is a collaboration between the Department of Biomedical Engineering of the University of Basel, the University Children's Hospital in Basel, and the Laboratory for Movement Biomechanics of the ETH ZÃ¼rich.
