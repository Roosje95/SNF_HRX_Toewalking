# SNF_HRX_Toewalking
Codes connected to our SNF Project: "Stop tip-toeing around toe-walking" Within the project we try to manipulate the feeling of stability by use of 1. VR or 2. bodyweight perturbations. We measure how a change in feeling of stability relates to changes in postural/dynamic stability and perifiral/cortical control.
