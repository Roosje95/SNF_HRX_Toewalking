# SNF_HRX_Toewalking
Codes connected to our SNF Project (Nr. 32003B_200903): "Stop tip-toeing around toe-walking". 

Within the project we try to manipulate the feeling of stability by use of 1. VR or 2. bodyweight perturbations. We measure how a change in feeling of stability relates to changes in postural/dynamic stability and perifiral/cortical control.

Motion capture (vicon), EMG (cometa), and force plates (kistler) were used to collect kinematics, muscle activity, and kinetics. 

Main scripts:
*m_Calculate_CoP_TwoForcePlates.m - calculates centre of pressure related outcomes from raw force plate inputs
*m_HRX_outcomes - calculates H-reflex related outcomes from EMG data of the soleus


The project is a collaboration between the Department of Biomedical Engineering of the University of Basel, the University Children's Hospital in Basel, and the Laboratory for Movement Biomechanics of the ETH ZÃ¼rich.
